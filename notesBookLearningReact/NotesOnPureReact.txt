Two important libraries:
   - React: library for creating views
   - React DOM: actually renders the UI in the browser

React elements:
   - react elements are instructions for how the browser DOM should be created.
   ex:
   ```js
      React.createElement("h1",null,"Test element")
   ```
   which during render get's converted to: <h1>Test element</h1>
   to add id's and data types:
   ```js
      React.createElement("h1",{id:"theId", 'data-type':"title"},"Test element")
   ```
